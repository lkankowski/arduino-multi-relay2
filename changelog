# 2.4.0

New features:
- Dependent relays
- Additional architectures: ESP8266, ESP32 (experimental)
- Ethernet (LAN or MQTT) with W5100 or ENC28J60
- Add multiple hardware combinations to platformio.ini so the user doesn't need to customize it so often

Improvements:
- Change button logic to be more independent from relays
- Create wrapper for MySensors dependency so it can be better tested

# 2.3.2 - Minor fixes
- improve Virtual pins
- typos fixes and revert remove "xstr" macro
- add timestamp to default serial monitor output

# 2.3.1 - Fixes and cleanup after release 2.3.0 Latest
- cleanup - remove some commented code
- add some inline directive
- increase relay and button description to 30 characters
- updated documentation (especially PROGMEM directive)
- fixed expander compilation errors
- added expander support in Configuration class
- added unit tests for Configuration class
- added compilation option in platformio.ini to increase serial buffer when having communication problems (SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE)

# 2.3.0 - Big architecture refactoring and new functionality - dependent relays
New functionality:
- Dependent relays and new configuration option "dependsOn"

Technical changes:
- Completely new software architecture to separate responsibility and add hardware abstraction for unit testing:
  - New class ButtonService
  - New class RelayService
  - New class Switch (hardware layer for buttons)
  - Separate class for every button type
  - Arduino abstraction layer - Arduino specific items located in ArduinoAbstract.h/cpp files
    - Common Pins interface including expander implementation
  - new class Eeprom - EEPROM abstraction for testing
  - new class Configuration
- Unit testing in native mode (on local PC) - thanks to Arduino abstraction/mock most code can be unit tested
- Ability to validate configuration in native mode
- Removed Bounce2 library
- Configuration and all strings moved to flash memory - free SRAM memory
- Removed all usages of String class (less memory consumption)
- All serial output using C++ streams ("Serial << â€¦")

# 2.2.1 - Sensor reporting
- reporting REED_SWITCH as S_DOOR in MySensors

# 2.2.0
- Without sending V_ARMED
- Support MCP23017
